Thank your for your interest in joining our Data Operations team at Bigtincan!

As a next step in the interview process, we would like you to build a CLI recommender system capable of recommending items to users. Note, that we are not interested in the exact performance metrics, but rather wish to see how you approach the problem and what are your software engineering skills.

We highly appreciate your time and effort you spent on the task. We guarantee you that we are not going to use your solution for any business purposes without your explicit permission.

You have 1 week from the time this email was sent to return the solution. Please, include description in the README file with clear instructions how to use it. We must be able to reproduce your results in order to judge it!

In case you find any problem or doubts or any issues related to the question, please don't contact us for clarification. Instead, use your own judgement and make the necessary assumptions that you find appropriate, justifying them accordingly in your response.

Good luck and have fun!

## Problem Statement
Most of the work we do at Bigtincan is around understanding user behaviour.
In a broad sense, Bigtincan Hub is a content management platform, where users are creating and interacting with their content.

One of the major problems we try to solve in our Data Operations team is suggesting right content to people based on their previous interactions.

## Sample Data
The file `data.csv` is a comma-separated file containing a random sample of user-item interactions. Both users and items are recorded with a unique id.

## The Application
Your coding challenge is to design and build a recommender system that will accept a specific user id and output top ten recommended items.
The application should also provide at least three expected performance metrics when run in production. You are free to come up with any performance measure, but provide a clear description of your selection.

## Other information
Despite this being a small command line app, please approach this as you would a production problem using whatever approach to coding and testing you feel appropriate.

Please, feel free to extend the README file with any information you think is important, such as assumptions you made. You may wish to use it to explain any design decisions too.

## Submitting your solution
Assuming you use Git, when you're ready to submit your solution, please use `git bundle` to package up a copy of your repository (with complete commit history) as a single file and send it back to us in the reply email.

We're looking forward to your solution!
